Finite mixture models can be interpreted as a model representing heterogeneous sub-populations within the whole population. 
However, more care is needed when associating a mixture component with a cluster, because a mixture model may fit more components than the number of clusters. 
Modal merging via the mean shift algorithm can help identifysuch multi-component clusters. 
So far, most of the related works are focused on the Gaussian finite mixture. 
As the non-Gaussian finite mixtures gain attention, the need to address the component-cluster correspondence issue in these mixture models grows. 
In light of this issue, we introduce mode merging methods for several non-Gaussian finite mixtures including power-exponential, normal variance mixture and normal variance-mean mixture.
